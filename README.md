# Introduction
An application used to manage carpools for your company. This is the backend API half of the system. The WebClient is a separate projcet. With some setup and code changes, Carpül can become your company's carpool management tool. This app is the API  Carpül is powered by the following technologies:
1.	ASP .Net Core 2.2
2.	ApplicationInsights for tracing and logging
3.	Swagger API interface
4.	JWT authentication
5.	Moq testing framework
6.	.Net core dependency injection
7.	Entity Framework Core

This project was built by a team of three developers for their senior capstone project at Oregon State University.

## What I learned
1. Enabling CORS from a Web API (normally this was done before I'd join a team)
2. Setting up code for generating and validating JWT tokens for auth. Previously my auth implementations would use more abstracted techniques that relied on Azure Active Directory

## Previous skills I was able to practice
1. Setting up and using Azure Application Insights from a Web API and a Client for telemetry and logging
2. Structuring a Web API separating concerns in to the Controller, Services, and Repository layers
3. Entity framework but while learning the slight differences from the non-Core Entity
4. API configuration but while learning the slight differences from the non-Core API's
5. Setting up and using Swagger (https://swagger.io/) from a Web API
6. Architectural design and implementation of a Server/Client system using a lot of different tech, which are listed below:
